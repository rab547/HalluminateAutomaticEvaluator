BOOO Set 2,"hmail 1,2,3",How has Halluminate's shift from a pure developer-led growth model to a forward-deployed services approach influenced its revenue?,"The shift to a forward-deployed services approach has made Halluminate's offering more compelling, contributing to more signed contracts of revenue.","Halluminate's shift from a pure developer-led growth model to a forward-deployed services approach has been positively received by customers, as it addresses their demand for holistic up-skilling around evaluation-driven development. This pivot has led to more enthusiastic customer engagement and faster product iteration. The forward-deployed approach allows Halluminate to offer integration, labeling, and onboarding services, which has made the company more competitive against customers building evaluations themselves.
